GENERAL NOTES:

The MRF data is contained in the VolunteerX/MRF_Images/IM_0001 image.
This is a Nifti image containing a stack of 2000 images. These are the 2000 time points in the MRF acquisition.

The images in the T2 and Mask_Images folders are there solely for appropriate visualisation of the maps. They give masks of the brain as well as segmentations of white and grey matter.

Gaussian Smoothed 

* Images with G in title 
* S means that the smoothing is spatial rather than temporal 
* Number at end of file name is sigma (mean is zero) 

Median Filter 

* Images with MF in title 
* S means that the smoothing is spatial rather than temporal 
* Number at end of file name is kernel size 

Image Segmentation

Brain extraction was done using FSL BET and segmentation using FLIRT/FNIRT and SynthSeg. SynthSeg provides personal segmentations of both cortical and subcortical regions using a convolutional neural network. As large voxel sizes lead to partial volume effects, partial volume segmentations for white and grey matter were thresholded so that only voxels that contained 90% of the respective tissue were used in the calculation of numerical results.

The segmentation code is provided in the file 'processSynthSeg.sh' requires access to the original DICOM files and therefore is not runnable. It has been included for your information.
