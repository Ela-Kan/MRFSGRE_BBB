Bloch simulation code for a two compartment model with a semipermeable barrier 

INLUDING:
- 2D set of isochromats with frequency encoding 
- Exchange between two compartments
- Variable fractional compartment sizes  
- Variable permeability of barrier 
- Slice profile correction

IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS
 - The effects of relaxation are ignored during the RF pulses 
 - Between pulses all transverse magnetization has relaxed back to
   equilibrium
 - Frequencies in MHz have been converted to Hz to make the simulation
   easier to visualise
